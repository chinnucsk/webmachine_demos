Testing issue with wrq:get_cookie_value/2 truncating after forward slashes

Cookie value will be truncated if it is not quoted as described in RFC 2109:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2109/rfc2109


To see the issue in action:
1. Start the test app:
./start.sh

2. From another prompt issue a curl request with a cookie value (not quoted):
curl -b test="hello/world" http://localhost:8000

3. Notice only "hello" is returned for the value


**Repeat with quoting**


4. From another prompt issue a curl request with a cookie value (quoted):
curl -b test="\"hello/world\"" http://localhost:8000

5. Notice "hello/world" is returned for the value
